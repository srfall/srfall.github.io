Natural Heritage is an educational strategy game in which the goal is to balance economic and ecological targets.

### Main features
* It is Turn-based strategy game simulating a political career over 30 years
* Various voter groups have to be kept happy
* Climate change adds additional challenges

It was developed as part of a joint course between the students of the [Games Engineering programm](https://games.uni-wuerzburg.de/) (Jakob Seitz, Tobias Lengfeld, Jan Erik Fischer) & the [CCTB](https://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/cctb/cctb/) ([Daniel Vedder](https://github.com/veddox) & me).
My main task was creating the game design with [Daniel Vedder](https://github.com/veddox) & creating the 3D models.
